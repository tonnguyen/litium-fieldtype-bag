## Install
To install this Add-on to your site, you need a site running equivalent version of Litium. This Add-on's version is inlined with Litium's version. If its version is 6.0.0, that means it is built against Litium 6.0.0. 

Add this project to your existing Litium solution.

## How to use
Just like other field type:
1. Create a field with type GoogleMap ![Create Google Maps field](images/Field.PNG)
2. Edit the field to enter the Google Map Api key. Here is how to get the key: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
